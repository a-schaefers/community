IMPORTANT:
        This package is installed as /usr/bin/sinit
        Please update your kernel parameters
        accordingly,

        -> init=/bin/sinit

        Please keep in mind that sinit does not use
        the /etc/inittab file. The default busybox
        runit service supervisor may (optionally)
        still be initialized.

        The following /etc/rc.conf default config
        options are provided by this package and
        should probably be uncommented:

        -> # SINIT_ENABLE_RUNIT=1 <- launches the default busybox-runit
        -> # SINIT_ENABLE_GETTY=1 <- needed because we don't use inittab
        -> # SINIT_ENABLE_SHUTDOWN_HOOKS=1 <- needed for shutdown and reboot

USAGE:
        To shutdown:

        -> # kill -s USR1 1

        To reboot:

        -> # kill -s INT 1
