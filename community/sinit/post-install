NOTE:

        This package is installed as /usr/bin/sinit
        Please update your kernel parameters
        accordingly,

        -> e.g. init=/bin/sinit

NOTE:
        Also keep in mind that sinit does not use
        the /etc/inittab file. The default busybox
        runit service supervisor will still be
        initialized. To use a different supervisor,
        place the needed code in /etc/rc.conf and
        it will automatically be sourced and
        executed instead of busybox runit.

NOTE:
        The 'poweroff' and 'reboot' commands are
        located in /usr/local/bin . Modify your
        'PATH' accordingly or use alias functions

        -> poweroff () { /bin/kill -s USR1 1 ; }
        -> reboot () { /bin/kill -s INT 1 ; }
