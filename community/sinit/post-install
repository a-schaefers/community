NOTE:

        This package is installed as /usr/bin/sinit
        Please update your kernel parameters
        accordingly,

        -> e.g. init=/bin/sinit

NOTE:
        Please keep in mind that sinit does not use
        the /etc/inittab file. The default busybox
        runit service supervisor will still be
        initialized. To use a different supervisor,
        place the needed code in /etc/rc.supervisor
        and it will automatically be sourced
        instead of busybox runit. To launch e.g.
        busybox runit, we use the following:

        -> sh -c 'ubase-box respawn /usr/bin/runsvdir -P /var/service' &

        A similar line may be placed in
        /etc/rc.supervisor to launch an
        alternative...

NOTE:
        The 'poweroff' and 'reboot' commands are
        located in /usr/local/bin . Modify your
        'PATH' accordingly or use alias functions.
        In the future this may change when kiss
        gains slotting abilities.

        -> poweroff () { /bin/kill -s USR1 1 ; }
        -> reboot () { /bin/kill -s INT 1 ; }
