IMPORTANT:
        This package is installed as /usr/bin/sinit
        Please update your kernel parameters
        accordingly,

        -> init=/bin/sinit

        Please keep in mind that sinit does not use
        the /etc/inittab file. The default busybox
        runit service supervisor will still be
        initialized. To use a different supervisor,
        edit /etc/rc.conf and place script(s) in
        the /etc/rc.d/ directory suffixed with
        *.sh

        The following /etc/rc.conf default config
        options are provided by this package and
        should probably be uncommented:

        -> # SINIT_ENABLE_RUNIT=1 <- launches the default busybox-runit
        -> # SINIT_ENABLE_GETTY=1 <- needed because we don't use inittab

USAGE:
        To shutdown:

        -> # kill -s USR1 1

        Advanced users may place in /etc/sinit.d/
        a "rc.shutdown" file which will be sourced
        instead of /lib/init/rc.shutdown

        To reboot:

        -> # kill -s INT 1

        Users may opt to install the above commands
        as scripts in /usr/local/bin and modify it
        to the front of 'PATH'.

NOTE:
        In the future this [lack of poweroff and
        reboot scripts in /bin] may change if kiss
        gains slotting abilities or if busybox
        becomes optional. Another possibility is
        a suckless overlay with a forked busybox.
